# LegGL
An old engine based in OpenGL with Audio, Terrain, and other capabilities

note: only for demonstration purposes. 

To run: Go to LegGL/Release/ , extract folder, and run LegGL. 

- Many features were modified, recovered, and/or broken due to files being recovered from a failed harddrive at least once, and random tweaks through the years since it began as a test engine on XP. Overall it still works but needs some fixes.
